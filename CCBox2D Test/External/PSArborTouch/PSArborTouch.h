/*! \mainpage PSArborTouch
 
 PSArborTouch is a particle / spring physics engine optimised for 2D content 
 layout and eye-catching visual effects.
 
 The goal of PSArborTouch is to build a high-quality physics based graph layout 
 engine designed specifically for the Mac OSX and iOS.  The inspiration / 
 structure comes from [arbor] (https://github.com/samizdatco/arbor), a dynamic 
 and well structured javascript engine for the same purpose.
 
 
 ## Example Projects
 
 This distribution contains several examples that demonstrate the features of 
 PSArborTouch.  This includes those found in arbor.js and a few more that 
 explore other uses.
 
 
 ## Status
 
 _This library is functional but it is still a work in progress, see 
 [issues](https://github.com/epreston/PSArborTouch/issues) and 
 [milestones](https://github.com/epreston/PSArborTouch/issues/milestones)_
 
 PSArborTouch is a drop in solution that uses a GCD to keep the main application
 loop free and responsive.
 
 This project follows the [SemVer](http://semver.org/) standard. The API may 
 change in backwards-incompatible ways before the 1.0 release.
 
 
 ## Documentation
 
 You can generate documentation with [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org). The 
 example project includes a documentation build target to do this within Xcode.
 For more details, see the 
 [Documentation](https://github.com/epreston/PSArborTouch/wiki/Documentation) 
 page in this projects wiki.
